# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code for a predictive model of cardiovascular disease based on a dataset acquired from one of the multispecialty hospitals in India. The dataset is rich with over 14 common features, making it a valuable resource for research purposes. The dataset consists of 1000 subjects, each described by 12 features.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing to handle factors and categorical variables.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Utilization of logistic regression for cardiovascular disease prediction.
- Stepwise model selection using AIC for optimal feature inclusion.

## Dataset Source
